-   **Task Management**: Core functionalities to create, edit, and delete Jobs.
-   **Blade Templating**: A clean, responsive user interface built using Laravel Blade templates.
-   **Lightweight Database**: SQLite used for simplicity and fast setup.

## Technologies Used

## Installation

To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

-   PHP >= 8.0
-   Composer
-   SQLite
-   Laravel CLI

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Raderne/php-travail-now

    ```bash
    cd travail-now
    ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash

    cp .env.example .env
    ```
5. Generate an application key:
    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
    ```
6. Set up the SQLite database:
    - Create a `database` directory if it doesnâ€™t exist:
        ```bash
        mkdir database
        ```
    - Create an SQLite database file:
        ```bash
        touch database/database.sqlite
        ```
    - Update your `.env` file to set the database connection to SQLite:
        ```
        DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
        DB_DATABASE=/full/path/to/database.sqlite
        ```
7. Run database migrations:
    ```bash
    php artisan migrate
    ```
8. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```
    if you are using Laravel Herd, you can use the following command:
